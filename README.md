# synology-nginx-config
I wrote a blog post about creating a [custom NGINX config for Synology Web Station on DSM 7.2](https://manthings.net/custom-nginx-config-for-synology-web-station-on-dsm-7-2/) and thought I'd post the script here too. I hope you find it useful!

This bash script iterates over Synology Web Station NGINX config directory (DSM 7.2) and adds an include statement for your custom nginx.conf. I talk about boring stuff like this and more on my blog.
